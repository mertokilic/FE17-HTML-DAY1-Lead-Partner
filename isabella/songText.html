    <h1>Songtext: In The End</h1>

    <div>
      <p>
        It starts with one thing I don't know why It doesn't even matter how
        hard you try Keep that in mind I designed this rhyme To explain in due
        time
      </p>

      <br />

      <p><i>All I know </i></p>

      <p>
        Time is a valuable thing Watch it fly by as the pendulum swings Watch it
        count down to the end of the day The clock ticks life away
      </p>

      <p><i>i's so unreal</i></p>

      <p>
        Didn't look out below Watch the time go right out the window Trying to
        hold on, didn't even know I wasted it all
      </p>
   

    <p><i>just to watch you go</i></p>

   
      <p>
      I kept everything inside 
      And even though I tried, it all fell apart 
      What it meant to me Will eventually be a memory of a time when
      </p>
    </div>


    <div></div>
    <p> <b>
      I tried so hard And got so far 
      But in the end It doesn't even matter 
      I had to fall To lose it all 
      But in the end It doesn't even matter

      <p>
      One thing, I don't know why 
      It doesn't even matter how hard you try 
      Keep that in mind I designed this rhyme To remind myself how
      </p>
    

    <p><i>I tried so hard</i></p>

    
      <p>
      spite of the way you were mocking me 
      Acting like I was part of your property 
      Remembering all the times you fought with me 
      I'm surprised it got so 
      Things aren't the way they were before 
      You wouldn't even recognize me anymore 
      Not that you knew me back then 
      But it all comes back to me
      </p>
    

    <p><i>In the end</i></p>

    
      <p>
      You kept everything inside 
      And even though I tried, it all fell apart 
      What it meant to me will eventually be a memory of a time when
      </p>

    <div>
      <p>
      I've put my trust in you 
      Pushed as far as I can go 
      For all this There's only one thing you should know 
      I've put my trust in you 
      Pushed as far as I can go 
      For all this There's only one thing you should know
